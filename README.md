# Introduction
* The ATM Interface is a Java-based application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) user interface. This interface provides a user-friendly way for customers to interact with the ATM, allowing them to perform various banking operations, such as checking account balance, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and changing their PIN.

* The ATM Interface aims to replicate the real-world ATM experience and can be used as a starting point to develop a fully functional ATM system for banks or other financial institutions.

# Features
The ATM Interface offers the following features:

* Account Balance: Users can check their account balance.
* Withdraw Funds: Customers can withdraw money from their accounts.
* Deposit Funds: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
* Change PIN: Customers can change their ATM PIN for security purposes.
* User Authentication: The interface validates the user's credentials before allowing access to account-related functions.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear instructions and options for easy navigation.
# Technologies Used
The ATM Interface is built using the following technologies:

* Java: The core programming language used for the application logic.
* Swing: Java's graphical user interface (GUI) library for building the ATM interface.
* Git: Version control system to manage the source code.
# Installation
